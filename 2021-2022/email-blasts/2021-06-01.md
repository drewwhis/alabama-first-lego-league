Hello teams!

With June upon us and the official start of summer only a couple of weeks away, we know that many of you have entered full vacation mode! Our emails will continue through the summer months, but we do maintain our [email archive](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/tree/main/2021-2022/email-blasts) where you can quickly find every email from the current season.

We do recommend checking for our emails weekly (either in your email or on the GitHub) so that you will be aware of any grant opportunities that pop up between now and the start of the academic year!

## Team Member Registration - Challenge and Explore Only

*FIRST*&reg; is requiring all youth team members to officially register with their teams in the online Dashboard.

From *FIRST*&reg;: 
    
    Youth Team Members who have not registered will not be permitted to participate in FIRST remote and in-person team meetings, events, or competitions. 

Fortunately, they have provided detailed steps in the [Youth Registration System Overview](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-registration-system), and we have updated our Frequently Asked Questions pages to point to this resource.

If you have questions or issues registering your team members, you will need to contact *FIRST*&reg; HQ (rather than your local partners). They can be reached by email at firstteammembers@firstinspires.org or by phone at 800-871-8326 (Option “0”  for assistance).


## Useful Links

We've been working to expand the wiki pages on our GitHub beyond just the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions). We've also centralized the [Program Information](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/FIRST-LEGO-League) there as well.

We're adding a new section for [Useful Links](https://github.com/drewwhis/alabama-first-lego-league/wiki/Useful-Links). We hope to centralize all of the official sites from *FIRST*&reg; and LEGO&reg; into this section, so make sure to check there frequently! If you have any suggestions for the useful links, please let us know. Right now, we're planning on using it for official resources, but we are also considering an unofficial resources area.

Each program also has a Resource Library linked in our Useful Links. If you find a resource there you think we should be linking directly, please let us know!

Please be aware that many season-specific links you encounter will reference materials from the 2020-2021 season (rather than the current 2021-2022 season) until after the challenge release in August. We will update these links as soon as we can, as necessary.
